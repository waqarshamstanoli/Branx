              The franchise fee can vary depending on the size of the region,

              However there are two main categories of fees:

            <ol>
              <li>
                Initial franchise fee: This is a one-time payment that the
                franchisee makes to Banx to secure the right to operate a
                franchise. The initial franchise fee is typically $22,000.00
              </li>
              <li>
              Ongoing royalty fee: This is an ongoing fee that the franchisee
              pays to Banx, as a percentage of the franchisee’s profit. The
              royalty fee helps to cover the costs of Banx ongoing support and
              training.
